        "description": "In 2016, no assessment has been made regarding Burma's efforts to advance the elimination of the worst forms of child labor because this is the first year that efforts have been assessed and suggested actions provided for Burma. Based on research regarding Burma's efforts to combat the worst forms of child labor, the Government made several efforts, but the military was also complicit in the use of forced child labor. Government efforts in Burma included amending the Shops and Establishments Act and the Factories Act to raise the minimum age for work to 14 and the minimum age for dangerous work to 18 in these sectors. In addition, the military provided its personnel, training centers, and recruitment officials with training and improved age assessment and verification procedures to enhance the military's ability to identify and prevent child soldier recruitment. Burma's military released 112 children and young people who had been recruited into armed forces as children, and sanctioned 13 officers and 23 non-commissioned personnel for the recruitment and use of children in the armed forces. However, Burma's military continued to use some children as combatants, porters and cooks in conflict areas. Children in Burma also performed dangerous tasks in garment production. Despite steady progress, military oversight and monitoring of recruitment procedures were insufficient to completely eliminate the recruitment of children. In addition, the legal framework does not prohibit the recruitment and use of children by non-state armed groups, and it does not comprehensively identify hazardous work that is prohibited for children."

While the Government made efforts by launching the Children, Not Soldiers campaign to raise awareness about child protection and to penalize perpetrators that recruit child soldiers, South Sudan is receiving this assessment of no advancement because the Sudan People\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Liberation Army (SPLA) recruited, sometimes forcibly, children to fight the opposition group led by former Vice President Riek Machar. In addition, gaps in legislation continue to put children at risk and child labor laws are not effectively enforced."

        "description": "In 2014, Uzbekistan made efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, but was also complicit in the use of forced child labor in the cotton sector. While the central Government made concerted efforts to prevent and to remediate forced child labor in cotton production, Uzbekistan is receiving an assessment of no advancement because of government complicity in forced child labor, particularly at the local level. Although there was no evidence of a large-scale, centrally-coordinated, forced mobilization of children, some local officials, in more than an isolated incident, continued to mobilize children during the cotton harvest. In committing to end this practice, the Cabinet of Ministers declared its intent to ensure that no one under the age of 18 would participate in the cotton harvest; broadly communicated its new commitment through awareness-raising campaigns to prevent children from being forcibly mobilized to pick cotton; and sponsored after-school programs as an alternative to child labor. The Government also led a monitoring effort utilizing ILO methodology to observe the fall 2014 harvest in all cotton-growing regions of the country, finding 41 child laborers, assessing penalties to 19 school officials and farm managers for the use of child labor, and removing children from the fields. Despite efforts to end the mobilization of children, in the course of widespread mobilization of third-year secondary school students (predominantly age 18) to pick cotton, an unknown number of 17-year-old students were also mobilized through this practice. Independent observers also reported some cases in several provinces in which younger students were mobilized. In a few instances, reports indicate that a local government authority such as a district or regional governing official (hokim) or town mayor may have directly ordered the mobilization of students under age 18. In at least some cases, callers to hotlines for reporting labor violations in the harvest were unable to get through, leaving an important gap in the system for receiving and processing child labor complaints. The Government also maintained policies in the cotton sector that mandate regional harvest quotas and set crop prices at levels that create incentives for local administrators to forcibly mobilize labor, creating an ongoing risk of mobilized child labor. Several observers stated that any reduction in the mobilization of children was offset by an increase in the compulsory mobilization of adult labor, although this trend could not be confirmed. Some of these observers reported surveillance, intimidation, and detention by the local government authorities while attempting to gather information about labor practices in the cotton harvest."

Bacha bazi exists in all provinces of the country, with specific cases documented in the provinces of Balkh, Baghlan, Helmand, and Uruzgan during the reporting period. While some elements of bacha bazi are prohibited under existing Afghan law, the term is not specifically included or defined in the law, making it challenging for law enforcement officials to comprehensively address and compile statistics on these cases. Boys who are victims of bacha bazi are often treated as criminals rather than as victims. In addition, children in Afghanistan are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in armed conflict and forced labor in the production of bricks. Also, Afghanistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s labor inspectorate is not authorized to impose penalties for child labor violations, and the Government lacks sufficient programs to eliminate the worst forms of child labor."

The Government adopted the Child Labor (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, which set the minimum age for work at 14 and raised the minimum age for hazardous work to 18, bringing India into compliance with the international standards. The Government also increased the financial assistance available under the Rehabilitation of Bonded Labor Scheme for children rescued from human trafficking and sexual exploitation. However, children in India are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced labor in the production of garments and quarrying stones. The hazardous work list attached to the new Child Labor Amendment Act is not comprehensive as it does not include areas of work where there is evidence that children work in unsafe and unhealthy environments for long periods of time. Also, while the Child Labor Act increases the penalties for employing children in prohibited child labor, these penalties are likely to be insufficient to deter violations. Additional gaps remain in the legal framework as the recruitment of children by non-state armed groups is not criminally prohibited."

Children also engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in domestic work, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Enforcement and implementation of child labor laws and regulations remain problematic, and there are no social programs specifically targeting children engaged in domestic work."

Decentralization, a lack of resources, and poor coordination have hampered the Government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to combat child labor, and laws mandating free primary education are not enforced."

The Government launched a project to expand the network of foster families throughout the nation, continued to implement a school feeding program which served approximately 215,000 children, and undertook a mapping project in Pointe-Noire to identify possible human trafficking rings and hotspots for commercial sexual exploitation. However, children in the Republic of the Congo are engaged in child labor, including in domestic work, and the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. The Government has yet to ratify the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons and there is no mechanism to coordinate the Government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts to address child labor, including all its worst forms.

The Government adopted and modestly implemented the National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Associated Practices (2015-2017), which provides protection and social assistance to victims of human trafficking, including children. The Government also established a referral mechanism between the National Directorate of Labor and the Ministry for the Promotion of Women, Children, and the Family to ensure that victims of child labor receive appropriate social services. In northern Mali, the Government made progress in providing access to education by reopening 89 percent of the schools for the 2014\/15 academic year. However, children in Mali are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in gold mining and the production of rice. Children were also abducted and forcibly recruited by armed rebel and extremist Islamic militia groups, and some of these children were detained and charged with crimes for their association with these groups. Laws relating to the worst forms of child labor do not provide adequate coverage, and gaps in enforcement have left children unprotected."

With technical support from the International Labor Organization, the Government engaged in the design of a national child labor and forced labor survey that will provide detailed information on the prevalence and nature of these issues in Timor-Leste. However, children in Timor-Leste are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture. Although the National Commission against Child Labor drafted a decree-law specifying the occupations and activities prohibited for children, the decree-law has not yet been enacted, leaving children vulnerable to engagement in hazardous work. Limited financial and human resources make it challenging for inspectors and investigators to enforce laws related to the worst forms of child labor, especially in more remote areas of the country."

        "description": "In 2014, Eritrea made efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, but was also complicit in the use of forced child labor and forced military recruitment of children. While the Government ratified the Palermo Protocol on Trafficking in Persons, Eritrea is receiving this assessment of no advancement because it continued to require children to participate in a national program called Maetot, under which children in grades 9 to 11 engage in agricultural, environmental, or hygiene-related public works projects for varying amounts of time during their annual summer holidays from school. In addition, although Eritrean law prohibits the recruitment of children under age 18 into the armed forces, there may be children enrolled in the Government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s compulsory military training program. Gaps in the legal framework exist, including a lack of specific penalties for employers of children in hazardous work and employers of children under the minimum age for work."

In addition, the Government reestablished the Council for the Rights of the Child to implement the National Plan for Children and adopted a new action plan to implement the Strategy for the Improvement of the Position of Roma and Other Minorities. However, children in Montenegro are engaged in child labor, including in begging and in the worst forms of child labor, including in forced begging. The Government has not determined the types of hazardous occupations prohibited for children, and there are no programs that systematically address the problem of children involved in forced begging and other work on the streets."

There are no laws or regulations that prohibit possessing child pornography or benefitting from its proceeds, and the age of consent for sexual relationships is not clearly defined. The National Action Plan for Child Protection and the National Program for Combating Human Trafficking remained underfunded in 2014. Furthermore, shelter and rehabilitation centers for children, including street children and victims of human trafficking, are insufficient to fully address the extent of the problem."

The Government expanded the National Action Plan to End Child Labor in Garbage Scavenging to include a study of adolescent work in agriculture in rural areas and established the Office of Rural Employment within the Ministry of Labor to work directly with rural communities. The Ministry of Labor hired 20 additional labor inspectors and the Ministry of Interior held a series of workshops to train police, immigration officials, prosecutors, and judges on human trafficking issues. However, children in Uruguay continue to engage in the worst forms of child labor in garbage scavenging and commercial sexual exploitation. The Government does not collect or publish information on the number of investigations, prosecutions, and convictions for labor and criminal law violations. Uruguay lacks a comprehensive national child labor policy, and programs to prevent and eliminate child labor are limited."

        "description": "In 2014, Uzbekistan made efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor, but was also complicit in the use of forced child labor in the cotton sector. While the central Government made concerted efforts to prevent and to remediate forced child labor in cotton production, Uzbekistan is receiving an assessment of no advancement because of government complicity in forced child labor, particularly at the local level. Although there was no evidence of a large-scale, centrally-coordinated, forced mobilization of children, some local officials, in more than an isolated incident, continued to mobilize children during the cotton harvest. In committing to end this practice, the Cabinet of Ministers declared its intent to ensure that no one under the age of 18 would participate in the cotton harvest; broadly communicated its new commitment through awareness-raising campaigns to prevent children from being forcibly mobilized to pick cotton; and sponsored after-school programs as an alternative to child labor. The Government also led a monitoring effort utilizing ILO methodology to observe the fall 2014 harvest in all cotton-growing regions of the country, finding 41 child laborers, assessing penalties to 19 school officials and farm managers for the use of child labor, and removing children from the fields. Despite efforts to end the mobilization of children, in the course of widespread mobilization of third-year secondary school students (predominantly age 18) to pick cotton, an unknown number of 17-year-old students were also mobilized through this practice. Independent observers also reported some cases in several provinces in which younger students were mobilized. In a few instances, reports indicate that a local government authority such as a district or regional governing official (hokim) or town mayor may have directly ordered the mobilization of students under age 18. In at least some cases, callers to hotlines for reporting labor violations in the harvest were unable to get through, leaving an important gap in the system for receiving and processing child labor complaints. The Government also maintained policies in the cotton sector that mandate regional harvest quotas and set crop prices at levels that create incentives for local administrators to forcibly mobilize labor, creating an ongoing risk of mobilized child labor. Several observers stated that any reduction in the mobilization of children was offset by an increase in the compulsory mobilization of adult labor, although this trend could not be confirmed. Some of these observers reported surveillance, intimidation, and detention by the local government authorities while attempting to gather information about labor practices in the cotton harvest."

The Government enacted the Anti-Trafficking Law that carries more stringent penalties for offenders and adopted a Constitution that explicitly prohibits child labor and enshrines the right to education for both boys and girls. The National School of Administration integrated new modules on child labor into the curriculum for labor inspectors. With the assistance of UNICEF, the Government published a report on the expansion of its child labor monitoring system, SOSTECI, that included child labor prevalence data in three departments. In addition, the First Ladies of Ghana and C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ivoire signed a joint declaration and cooperative agreement against cross-border human trafficking. The Government also launched a Ten-Year Education Training Plan and entered a partnership agreement with the International Cocoa Initiative to expand SOSTECI and improve school infrastructure in support of the National Action Plan for the Fight Against the Worst Forms of Child Labor. However, children in C\u00c3\u00b4te d\u00e2\u0080\u0099Ivoire engage in the worst forms of child labor in the harvesting of cocoa and coffee, sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Gaps remain in enforcement efforts, and the labor inspectorate is not authorized to assess penalties."

The Government established the National Strategy to Eradicate Child Labor and Protection of Adolescent Workers (2015\u00e2\u0080\u00932025). Two bills were drafted and submitted to Congress; the first requires adherence to the rights enumerated in the Convention of the Rights of the Child, while the second creates an Undersecretary for Children to evaluate policies relating to children and address gaps. Chile also continued to implement several programs targeting the worst forms of child labor. However, children in Chile are engaged in child labor, including in construction, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in the production and distribution of drugs sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Information regarding the number of potential criminal violations found and prosecutions initiated related to the worst forms of child labor is not publicly available.\n\n"

The Government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Department of Home Affairs published new regulations for the 2002 Immigration Act that includes new documentation requirements intended to prevent the illegal movement of children. The Government\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Department of Social Development also implemented a food relief program for households with vulnerable and orphaned children, as well as child-headed households. Studies also indicate that the Government's Child Support Grant and the Old Age Pension may help reduce child labor. However, children in South Africa are engaged in child labor, including agriculture and domestic work. Government social programs to address child labor do not match the scope of the problem and barriers to education access remain. The Government also does not make enforcement data publicly available."

        "description": "In 2014, Thailand made a significant advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. Despite political unrest during the year and a military coup in May 2014, the Government took actions to address child labor. Thailand made changes to its legal framework to raise the minimum age for agricultural work from 13 to 15 years, and for work on sea fishing vessels from 16 to 18 years. It also created a national policy committee, including several subcommittees and task forces, to improve policy formulation, interagency coordination, and implementation regarding migrant workers and human trafficking problems. In addition, the Government funded and participated in multiple programs that include the goal of eliminating or preventing child labor, including its worst forms. However, children in Thailand continue to engage in child labor in agriculture, including in the shrimp and seafood processing sector, and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Thailand remains weak in its enforcement efforts, particularly in the fishing, agriculture, manufacturing, and home-based business sectors, as well as in the informal sector. The Government also lacks nationwide data on child labor, which impedes the effectiveness of policies and programs."

In addition, the National Council on Children established an inter-ministerial task force to coordinate resource allocation and programming on child labor across ministries. However, children in Uganda are engaged in child labor, including in agriculture and in the worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. Gaps in the legal framework persist, such as between compulsory education and minimum working ages, and enforcement information is not made publicly available."

Since 1984, the Government has regulated access to secondary education through the Primary School Leaving Exam (PSLE). Students who do not pass the exam do not have an opportunity to re-take the exam. As a result, students must drop out and do not have the opportunity to continue their education. As students in Tanzania and Zanzibar complete primary education at the average age of 14, children in Zanzibar who do not pass the exam can find themselves both out of formal education and still below the minimum age for work, which is 15 in Zanzibar, leaving such children at increased risk of child labor. While the Government has expressed its intention to phase out the exam by 2021, it has yet to initiate efforts or make preparations to do so. Children also engage in the worst forms of child labor, including in mining, quarrying, and domestic work.

        "description": "In 2014, Bolivia made a minimal advancement in efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor. The Ministry of Labor increased its number of labor inspectors from 78 to 95, and dedicated 9 of these inspectors to investigating child labor in high-risk areas. The Government also published a national policy to combat human trafficking that aims to implement the Comprehensive Law against Human Trafficking and Smuggling. However, children in Bolivia are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and in mining. Bolivia has received an assessment of minimal advancement because in July 2014, the Government passed a new Child and Adolescent Code that allows children as young as 10 years old to be self-employed under certain conditions. This action undermined the advancements made in eliminating child labor. In addition, the Offices of the Child Advocate, required by the new Code to authorize child work and assist victims of child labor, are absent or underfunded in many municipalities, leaving some children unprotected and vulnerable to the worst forms of child labor. The Government also lacks a comprehensive child labor policy."

Despite new initiatives to address child labor, the Dominican Republic is receiving this assessment because certain children remain at increased vulnerability to labor exploitation due to limitations on educational opportunities related to the interpretation and implementation of Dominican law and policies on the right to education. During the reporting period, the Government passed a new Penal Code that increases penalties for the commercial sexual exploitation of children and ratified the UN CRC Optional Protocol on Armed Conflict. In addition, the Government signed the Protocol for the Protection of Children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and Adolescents\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Rights in Child Labor, which aims to eliminate child labor and increase school attendance. The Government also expanded educational programs and signed the Education Pact, a plan to reform the education system by improving teacher training, building more schools, and increasing attendance. However, children in the Dominican Republic are engaged in the worst forms of child labor, including in agriculture and in commercial sexual exploitation sometimes as a result of human trafficking. Due to misinterpretations and misapplications of Dominican law and policies on the right to education, school officials do not permit some children, particularly those of Haitian descent, to enroll in primary and secondary education without birth certificates or other identifying documentation. These incorrectly-applied provisions prevent or discourage children not entitled to Dominican documents, or unable to obtain documents from their countries of nationality, from enrolling in or completing school. In addition, difficulties in the implementation of a naturalization law passed in May 2014 have hindered the acquisition of both Haitian and Dominican identity documents under that law, adding to difficulties labor inspectors and employers have in verifying affected children\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ages for work."

This continued gap in enforcement delays the advancements made in eliminating child labor during the reporting period. Although the Government participated in a project to improve its ability to enforce labor laws and adhere to international labor standards, including those related to child labor, the Government did not take steps to establish a labor inspectorate during the reporting period.

Despite new initiatives to address child labor, Ukraine is receiving this assessment because it continued to implement a law that delayed advancement in eliminating the worst forms of child labor. Ukraine enacted legislation in 2014 that required the State Labor Service to request approval from the Cabinet of Ministers before conducting any inspection not related to a criminal investigation. This bureaucratic restriction effectively imposed a moratorium on inspections during the reporting period. Otherwise, the Government made efforts by providing training to a significant number of law enforcement personnel on the application of laws against child trafficking, adopting a new State Program for Countering Human Trafficking, and developing a comprehensive curriculum on human trafficking prevention for use in schools. Children in Ukraine are engaged in child labor, including in street work and in the worst forms of child labor, including in pornography.  The legal framework lacks prohibitions on possessing child pornography or benefitting from its proceeds, and the age of consent for sexual relationships is not clearly defined, which puts children at risk of prosecution in cases of commercial sexual exploitation.

The Government does not make law enforcement data publicly available and national laws and regulations do not identify hazardous occupations or activities prohibited for children.

Children in South Sudan are also engaged in other worst forms of child labor, including in commercial sexual exploitation. The Government neither brought to justice those who recruited or used children in armed conflict, nor held accountable perpetrators of any other form of child labor.

The Government expanded the monitoring activities of both the ILO-led Third Party Monitoring and its own Coordination Council-led monitoring. The Government also took steps to improve the Feedback Mechanism for reporting labor violations in the cotton harvest and investigated complaints of forced child and adult labor received through this mechanism. However, Uzbekistan is receiving an assessment of no advancement because there were reports that some local officials mobilized children to pick cotton in the region of Khorezm and the Republic of Karakalpakstan. There was no evidence of centrally-coordinated forced mobilization of children. However, the Government maintained policies in the cotton sector that mandate regional harvest quotas and set crop prices at levels that create incentives for local administrators to forcibly mobilize labor, creating an ongoing risk of forced child labor. Public confidence in the Feedback Mechanism remained low and some users reported retaliation for complaints, indicating flaws in the system for receiving and processing forced child labor complaints. Members of civil society who attempted to conduct independent monitoring of child labor in the cotton harvest reported experiencing harassment by the local government authorities. A Presidential Decree was issued in October 2016 prohibiting unannounced inspections in private businesses, including labor inspections. In addition to continued reports of the worst forms of child labor, including forced child labor in the cotton harvest, a limited number of reports indicate that children  may perform dangerous tasks in cultivating silk cocoons.\u00c2\u00a0Overall, gaps in law enforcement and insufficient coordination with provincial officials impede Uzbekistan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to fully address the child labor problem."
